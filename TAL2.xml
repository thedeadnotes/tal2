 <title>848: The Official Unofficial Record</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/848/the-official-unofficial-record</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you count almost 12 million votes if you’re not the government? This week, we bring you the extraordinary story of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who created the only verifiable public record of votes in their presidential election — and other stories of people trying to correct the official record with their own versions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://thisamericanlife.supercast.com?utm_id=lifepartners&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=shownotes&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org/lifepartners&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for our premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Host Ira Glass sets us up for Nancy Updike’s insider account of the recent presidential election in Venezuela. The story is an incredible national drama that plays out in thousands of polling stations across the country, with regular people trying to ensure a fair vote count that everyone can agree on. (2 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Producer Nancy Updike tells the story of the people of Venezuela trying to prove who won their recent presidential election beyond a shadow of a doubt. (22 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Host Ira Glass spent America’s presidential election in the swing state of Michigan, where he found very little dispute over the ballot count from Republican poll challengers in Detroit now that they are doing the counting themselves. (8 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: This story is about a creepy and dangerous creature that does all kinds of terrible things. It’s also about someone trying to set the record straight on those exact assumptions about this notorious creature. (9 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/848/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/page/privacy-policy&#039;&gt;This American Life privacy policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices&#039;&gt;Learn more about sponsor message choices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>846: This Is the Cake We Baked</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/846/this-is-the-cake-we-baked</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump’s victory this week, many people looked at the election results and thought, yeah, this is the country I thought it was. For some people, that was a hopeful thing. For others, kind of the opposite. This week, we talked with people who helped make it happen and some who are looking to what’s next.

Then he checks in with a DC cop who was injured at the Capitol on January 6. (7 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Trump has claimed that he will be able to deport between 15 and 20 million people. But neither he nor his team have spelled out exactly how they’d do it. Producer Nadia Reiman looked into what mass deportation could actually look like on the ground if and when it comes to pass. (17 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Trump won record numbers of Latino voters this year. Ike Sriskandarajah spent the day with a guy in Pennsylvania who&#039;s been working to bring Latino voters to Trump for years. (15 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: Ira talks with two of Trump’s “political enemies” about their post-election plans. (8 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Four: Ten different states had abortion rights measures on their ballots this election. Producer Miki Meek got curious about a particular kind of political ad that aired in many of those states and called up a few of the women whose stories were featured in them.

 <title>843: A Little Bit of Power</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/843/a-little-bit-of-power</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So much of the fight for the presidency is coming down to battles for small slices of voters who can help throw swing states to one candidate or another. Abbas Alawieh, a leader in the Uncommitted movement, grapples with how to get his voters the thing they want.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://thisamericanlife.supercast.com&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org/lifepartners&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for our premium subscription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: When you have some power, but not a lot, how do you wield it when you’re suddenly cast into the spotlight? (4 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Zoe Chace and Ben Terris follow Abbas Alawieh as he fights to broker a deal at the DNC – a way to potentially satisfy the people who voted “Uncommitted” in the primaries as a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the war in Israel and Gaza.

 <itunes:subtitle>Abbas Alawieh, a leader in the Uncommitted movement, grapples with how to get his voters the thing they want.
</itunes:subtitle>
 <itunes:summary>So much of the fight for the presidency is coming down to battles for small slices of voters who can help throw swing states to one candidate or another. Abbas Alawieh, a leader in the Uncommitted movement, grapples with how to get his voters the thing they want.


Prologue: When you have some power, but not a lot, how do you wield it when you’re suddenly cast into the spotlight? (4 minutes)

Act One: Zoe Chace and Ben Terris follow Abbas Alawieh as he fights to broker a deal at the DNC – a way to potentially satisfy the people who voted “Uncommitted” in the primaries as a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the war in Israel and Gaza. (33 minutes)

Act Two: Three weeks after the Democratic National Convention, Abbas speaks at a tense community meeting in Michigan about the Uncommitted organizers’ general election recommendation and hears back from voters on how they feel about the Democratic nominee at this point.
